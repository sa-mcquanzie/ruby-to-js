## 1. Variables

### In Ruby:

Variables are simply assigned with the equals sign.

> `cat = 'Rufus'`

### In Javascript:

There are three ways of assigning variables

Old style variable assignment using `var` creates a variable which is mutable and, by default, globally accessible. 

> `var dog = 'Mable'`

New style variable assignment uses `const` and `let` are only accesible from the scope in which they are defined.

`const` can not be reassigned after is is created, try to use it unless you _need_ to do so

> `const sphereEulerCharacteristic = 2`

but `let` can be reassigned any time within its scope

> `let childHeight = 160`
